# Mobile UI Parity

Tolaria mobile UI work starts from fixture-driven parity with desktop semantics. The iPad baseline copies desktop visual contracts first, then documents any mobile adaptation as an explicit exception. The goal is to avoid invented mobile UI while production logic is still static.

## Copy-First Rule

Desktop Tolaria is the visual source of truth for the first iPad version. React Native surfaces should copy the desktop component contract before adding mobile-specific behavior.

Allowed differences must be documented as exceptions:

| Exception | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Native layout engine limits | Keep the same semantic contract and closest measurable dimensions. |
| Touch targets | Increase only when the desktop hit area is too small to use reliably. |
| Tablet panel navigation | Swipe/hide/reveal behavior can adapt the layout shell, not component styling. |
| Phone reduction | Phone UI may remove/reflow surfaces after tablet parity is stable. |

If a visible difference is not listed as an exception, treat it as a bug.

## Parity Contract

Mobile desktop-derived constants live in:

```text
apps/mobile/src/ui/desktopParity.ts
```

The visible iPad component coverage map lives in:

```text
apps/mobile/src/ui/mobileParityInventory.ts
```

`mobileParityInventory.test.ts` fails when a visible iPad implementation component has no desktop source, parity contract, or assertion listed.

That file records the source values for the current iPad surface:

| Contract | Desktop source | Mobile users |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `desktopSidebarParity` | `SidebarTopNav`, `SidebarGroupHeader`, `NavItem`, `FolderItemRow` | `MobileWorkspaceSidebar` |
| `desktopNoteItemParity` | `NoteItem` | `MobileListRow`, `MobileNoteListPanel` |
| `desktopPropertyParity` | `propertyPanelLayout`, `propertyChipStyles`, `RelationshipsPanel` | `MobilePropertyRow`, `MobileChip`, `MobilePropertiesPanel` |
| `desktopEditorParity` | `theme.json`, `EditorTheme.css` | `TabletEditorPanel` |
| `desktopPanelParity` | desktop split-pane widths and 52px chrome | tablet sidebar, note list, editor, properties |

The mobile snapshot also carries Type-note schema metadata into `MobileTypeDefinition.properties` and `MobileTypeDefinition.relationships`. `MobilePropertiesPanel` uses that schema to render the same missing type-derived property and relationship slots that the desktop inspector derives from Type entries, followed by the desktop suggested slots (`Status`, `Date`, `URL`, `belongs_to`, `related_to`, `has`). Placeholder rows must open the normal add-property or add-relationship sheet with the key prefilled; they must not create a separate mobile-only editing path.

## Fast QA Loop

Routine mobile UI work on `mobile-ui-foundation` uses the scoped checks:

```bash
pnpm mobile:lint
pnpm mobile:typecheck
pnpm mobile:test
pnpm mobile:qa:screenshots
pnpm mobile:qa:ios-layout
pnpm mobile:qa:ios-simulator
```

`pnpm mobile:qa:screenshots` exports the Expo web bundle, serves it locally, drives the UI lab with Playwright, and writes screenshots plus a manifest to:

```text
/tmp/tolaria-mobile-ui-screenshots
```

The screenshot suite also contains objective parity assertions for tablet landscape. These assertions fail on regressions such as:

- selected note rows not spanning the full note-list panel
- panel widths, toolbar height, toolbar padding, or toolbar title typography drifting from desktop chrome
- invented primary-blue note selection when desktop uses the note type color
- rounded/margined note row wrappers instead of desktop full-width rows
- missing note row separators
- sidebar section padding drifting from desktop `SidebarTopNav` and `SidebarGroupHeader`
- sidebar count pills losing desktop rounded pill sizing
- properties rows drifting from desktop 28px row density and 12px muted labels
- relationship rows losing full-width typed color, 6px radius, or desktop padding
- editor H1, paragraph, quote, and table primitives drifting from `theme.json`
- toolbar icon actions reverting to oversized mobile card buttons
- sync footer becoming an oversized mobile bar instead of the 30px desktop status bar

The same Playwright suite also compares the primary tablet-landscape screen against a committed pixel baseline and checks that mobile parity constants still match desktop `src/index.css` and `src/theme.json`.

`pnpm mobile:qa:ios-layout` opens the native Expo Go deep link with `layoutProbe=1`, reads `TOLARIA_MOBILE_LAYOUT_METRIC` lines from the iPad Simulator logs, and fails when native React Native row boxes drift from the desktop parity contract. This is mandatory for padding, margin, row-height, indentation, text line boxes, text vertical centering, and count-pill alignment because the Expo web/browser lane can pass while the iPad simulator renders differently.

`pnpm mobile:qa:ios-workspace-persistence` and `pnpm mobile:qa:ios-phone-workspace-persistence` exercise reducer write plans through the native Expo filesystem repository. The proof must cover note create/save/move/delete/restore, folder writes including restore, saved-view create/update/delete/reorder/restore writes, Type definition create/update/delete/rename/reorder/restore changes, relationship target creation and wikilink rewrites, note metadata, vault-scoped config, and property display-mode hydration.

`pnpm mobile:qa:ios-simulator` opens the native Expo Go deep link with `layoutProbe=1`, sets the currently booted iPad Simulator to landscape, and captures it into:

```text
/tmp/tolaria-mobile-ui-simulator/ipad-landscape.png
```

Use it after launching Expo on iOS with `pnpm mobile:ios`. The command refreshes Expo Go before capture, so the artifact matches the native app surface rather than Mobile Safari, the Expo web build, or a stale foreground Simulator app. The native QA scripts reject `http://` and `https://` open URLs because those launch Mobile Safari; automated native acceptance must use `exp://`, `exps://`, or `tolaria://` deep links.

If Expo Go is not already focused, open the running native bundle first:

```bash
pnpm mobile:ios
pnpm mobile:qa:ios-simulator
```

For tablet UI review, treat the native metric gate and simulator artifact as mandatory alongside Playwright screenshots. Playwright catches measurable parity regressions quickly; the simulator screenshot catches native Expo Go rendering differences that browser automation can miss. Use `--open-url` only for native deep links such as `exp://...`; an `http://...` URL opens Mobile Safari and is not an acceptance target for the mobile app.

For padding, margin, row-height, and indentation regressions, do not rely on screenshots alone. Enable the layout probe and compare measured React Native layout numbers against the desktop parity contract:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_TOLARIA_LAYOUT_PROBE=1 pnpm mobile:start
xcrun simctl terminate booted host.exp.Exponent || true
xcrun simctl openurl booted 'exp://<host-ip>:8081'
```

The native app emits `TOLARIA_MOBILE_LAYOUT_METRIC` lines for probed sidebar rows. A healthy sidebar row should report desktop-derived content insets, row heights, and text boxes, for example `sidebar.item.inbox.content.x = 12`, `sidebar.item.inbox.row.height = 32`, `sidebar.item.inbox.label.height = 18`, and nested folder content offsets of `12 + depth * 25`. The browser screenshot lane also runs `enforces measured sidebar row layout invariants` with `?layoutProbe=1`, but native metrics remain required because React Native browser rendering can pass while the iPad simulator is wrong.

The harness also exercises a read-only real-vault path. By default it looks for:

```text
/Users/luca/Laputa
```

Set `MOBILE_QA_VAULT_PATH` to override that path. The loader scans Markdown files read-only, injects a `MobileWorkspaceSnapshot` into local storage, and captures `local-vault` tablet/phone screenshots without touching vault content.

Large-vault QA currently checks:

- local snapshot read/build duration
- initial tablet render from the injected snapshot
- note switching
- type navigation
- folder navigation

The default screenshot matrix is:

| Target | Viewport | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tablet landscape | 1366 x 1024 | First production target and primary quality bar |
| Tablet portrait | 1024 x 1366 | Tablet reflow and panel density |
| Phone portrait | 390 x 844 | Early visibility into phone reduction pressure |

The tablet state matrix currently captures:

| Scenario | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `default` | Baseline sidebar, note list, editor, properties, and sync footer |
| `selected-open-source-project` | Note selection state and properties refresh |
| `empty-inbox` | Empty list, no selected note, empty editor, empty properties, pull-required sync |
| `long-title` | Long title pressure across note rows, toolbar, and editor heading |
| `property-heavy` | Multi-tag note, grouped multi-value relationships, and property actions |
| `folder-tree` | Vault folder tree pressure in tablet landscape |
| `local-vault` | Real read-only vault data, large counts, real folders/types, relationships, and markdown pressure |

The phone navigation matrix currently captures:

| Scenario | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `initial` | Full-screen note list |
| `sidebar-open` | Left drawer over the note list, leaving a visible strip of list content on the right |
| `editor-open` | Note editor opened from the right with a back path to the list |
| `long-title-list` | Phone note list pressure with long titles |
| `property-heavy-editor` | Phone editor pressure with the property-heavy selected note |

Run the full desktop/native Tolaria gate only before promotion or when desktop/native production files are intentionally changed:

```bash
TOLARIA_MOBILE_FULL_GATE=1 git push
```

## Surface Parity Map

| Priority | Desktop Source | Mobile Target | Required Fixture States | Acceptance Bar |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Sidebar navigation | Native sidebar rail/list | all notes, inbox, archive, favorites, types, long counts | Copy desktop section padding, group labels, count pills, active states, and folder row density |
| P0 | Note list | Native note list panel | selected note, favorite note, long title, multi-chip note, empty search | Copy desktop full-width row surface, separators, type-colored selected state, typography, and chip density |
| P0 | Editor shell | Native editor container | title, rich text preview, empty note | Copy desktop editor theme values for content width, title separator, headings, body, lists, quotes, and tables |
| P0 | Properties panel | Native property rows | type, date, status, relationships, empty values | Copy compact 12px labels, 24px chips, full-width relationship rows, and property-action rows |
| P1 | Search and quick open | Native search overlay/sheet | empty query, results, no results, keyboard focus | Results can be scanned quickly; touch, Enter, Escape, and clamped ArrowUp/ArrowDown selection are deterministic |
| P1 | Create note/type/status/property actions | Native modal/sheet controls | valid input, invalid input, type selection, typed property values, collision | Controls use Tolaria primitives; disabled/loading/error states are visible |
| P2 | Phone shell | Reduced navigation and panels | list-only, editor-only, properties sheet, back stack | Phone removes surfaces deliberately after tablet parity is established |

## Writable Interaction Boundary

The tablet and phone shells route editing actions through reducer-owned write plans and the workspace repository boundary. Fixture and web-host runs may stay process-local for QA isolation, but `source=native` runs persist through the Expo filesystem repository.

| Flow | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Sidebar sections and folders | Filter the note list, select the first visible note, and expose folder create/rename/delete/move actions |
| Note rows | Select the note and refresh editor/properties |
| Search | Opens a desktop-parity sheet, filters the visible note list, and lets touch or keyboard-selected results select a note |
| Create note/type/view | Opens localized forms, applies desktop-compatible defaults, and writes Markdown or view files |
| Add/edit property | Opens typed property controls, updates frontmatter, and persists configured display modes in vault-scoped mobile config |
| Add/remove relationship | Uses note suggestions or creates a target note, then persists wikilink frontmatter |
| Favorite, archive, organize, delete, move, rename | Apply reducer write plans and persist note/frontmatter/file-path changes |
| Editor content | Uses WYSIWYG or source editing over a single Markdown document; no mobile-only title/body split |

Do not wire direct vault writes into presentation components. New mutations should stay behind `MobileWorkspaceEdit` and `MobileWorkspaceWrite`, then prove native persistence through the focused iOS probes when the behavior touches repository writes.

## Mobile Primitive Layer

Mobile UI follows the same ownership model as desktop shadcn/ui. RNR-derived primitives live locally in `apps/mobile/src/components/ui`, and Tolaria-specific wrappers/compositions live in `apps/mobile/src/ui`.

Use the local primitive layer before adding new raw React Native controls. Product-specific surfaces can still use native `View`, `ScrollView`, and `Pressable` where they model Tolaria behavior, but text, buttons, badges/chips, and future shared controls should flow through the local RNR-backed components whenever practical.

## Per-Surface Workflow

1. Identify the desktop source component or workflow.
2. Add its values to `desktopParity.ts` or reuse an existing contract.
3. Add or update fixture data for the relevant states.
4. Compose the screen from `apps/mobile/src/components/ui` primitives and `apps/mobile/src/ui` Tolaria wrappers.
5. Add parity assertions for measurable invariants before relying on screenshot review.
6. Run the fast QA loop and inspect screenshots.
7. Add interaction checks for taps, selection, scrolling, and state transitions.
8. Wire real data only after the fixture surface passes visual and interaction QA.

## Quality Rules

- Tablet landscape is the quality bar until the tablet shell is stable.
- Phone UI is allowed to lag, but screenshots must reveal where reduction is needed.
- Screens must avoid browser-default styling, text overlap, unstable dimensions, and decorative-only surfaces.
- Mobile-specific copy must go through the shared locale catalog when it becomes production UI copy.
- Business logic is not a substitute for visual completeness. A surface is not ready to wire until the fixture state is coherent.
